## Models

The `COMMON_` schema is where our Enterprise Dimensional Model (EDM) lives. The EDM is GitLab’s centralized data model, designed to enable and support the highest levels of accuracy and quality for reporting and analytics. The data model follows the [Kimball](https://www.kimballgroup.com/data-warehouse-business-intelligence-resources/kimball-techniques/dimensional-modeling-techniques/) technique, including a Bus Matrix and Entity Relationship Diagrams.
